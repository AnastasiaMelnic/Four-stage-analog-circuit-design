I designed a four-stage analog circuit in LTSpice, including a non-inverting amplifier, a KHN low-pass filter, a programmable-gain amplifier (PGA), and a full-wave rectifier. I performed AC and DC sweeps, and transient simulations to ensure that the circuits meet the requirements for gain, bandwidth, and THD (<1% ).
